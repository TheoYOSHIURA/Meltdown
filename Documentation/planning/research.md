## [What makes a Bad First Chapter? (R/writing)](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/maeml1/what_makes_a_bad_first_chapter/)

**sneep_snopped**:
  
> As a reader for a lit mag, the biggest goof ups I see tend to be focusing on the wrong things either through 1) massive amounts of exposition or 2) false promises.
> 
> Infodumps
> 
> Notice when you slip into description rather than putting us in the moment. Try to drop us straight into the plot. I see a lot of writers kick off a great intro paragraph with action, tension, or some sort of motive, but then spend the next couple pages describing how some character met their spouse or how their parents died or whatever. At that point, the reader doesn't care.
> 
> Imagine meeting a stranger and they immediately launch into a story about how their kid died of cancer. You might feel a little sad, but you'd mostly feel awkward because you don't know this stranger.
> 
> Now, if you had this same conversation with a new neighbor who you'd gotten to know over a couple months before they opened up, your heart would break. You might even remember different behaviors or tidbits from conversations that, 20/20, make a lot more sense. In fact, the first moment you met them, they had were unloading boxes from a moving truck. There was a teddy bear and a tricycle in the back, but no kids. It all makes sense!
> 
> Apply this logic to your first chapter and see if your main character is being an awkward, over-sharing goose. Apply this to yourself as a narrator and decide whether you're painting a scene or smacking the reader with a textbook.
> 
> False promises
> 
> Say you spend three pages out of the first chapter talking about a character, dead mother, a relationship, a town, etc. I'm going to assume it's super important because that's a lot of time to spend on something within your intro. If you never bring them up again, I'm going to feel cheated. Those same three pages anywhere in the middle of the book isn't as big a deal though because you aren't making the same promises as you are when putting it in the intro.
> 
> The reason dream sequences are frowned upon for the first chapter is because they feel like fake outs. The first chapter is to introduce the character(s), motives, and stakes, but if it's all a dream, you're getting the reader invested and hitting the reset button. It feels like a betrayal. It's also probably done in a different style than the rest of the book, which means they don't know what to expect on that front either. There are exceptions to this rule, of course. "Inception" starts with a dream because dreams are extremely important to its world building. "Umbrella Academy" also uses time travel to reset some stuff, but the reader still learned worthwhile info and all the main characters stay together, which means the relationship building wasn't wiped away even if the surrounding world was.

**Escaho**:
  
> Reasons I will drop a book after the first chapter:
> 
> • Poor grammar and/or punctuation (more than three obvious errors in Chapter 1; more than one obvious error for every other chapter).
> 
> • A lack of conflict and/or tension (which is usually provided to the reader in the form of giving us a protagonist with a goal that they want to accomplish or will eventually have to solve).
> 
> • Unrealistic dialogue (specifically, for the world that the characters exist in).
> 
> • Overabundance of descriptions (especially if they are about pointless things, such as how beautiful the weather is or a laundry list of every item in a room that won't come into play beyond the paragraph it is mentioned).
